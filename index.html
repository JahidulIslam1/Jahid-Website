    <p>
    It would not be long before I started getting more <b><span class="color1">website projects</span></b>. I started by using html/css templates that I could easily implement and customize and I cranked out several websites in this fashion. It also helped to refresh and expand my limited development knowledge base.

     <p>
    From my first “Hello, World!” to my first function, i pick up basic skills at a remarkable pace. I feel like am accomplishing with a great deal, and this is for good reason: <b>the beginner level is supposed to be easy</b>. This is an excellent example of an equally excellent learning tool at work: engagement and curiosity are high, and small, consistent successes create high self-confidence
